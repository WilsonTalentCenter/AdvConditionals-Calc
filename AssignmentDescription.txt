/* This assignment has 3 parts (1 of which you alread completed)
part1:  Create test cases for this assignment.
part2:  Create a Flowchart or pseudo code for this program- This will not be turned in but will be used as part of the explanation.
part3:  Create the code in intellij for the program below.
*/

/*
Create a simple calculator that supports +,-,/,*  operators, see details below

The program should ask for a number using the following prompt: "enter number for operand:"
The program should ask for an operator using the following prompt: "enter an operand (+,-,/,*):"
The program should ask for a second number using the following prompt: "enter number for operand:"
The program should then calculate the result based on the inputs and display the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.

The program should only accept numbers greater than -1000 and less than 1000  (exclusive)  and should treat numbers outside this range as an invalid input.
Any invalid inputs should result in the following message:  "Invalid Input"  and close the program (Note: System.exit(-1); is one way to close the program).

Assumptions: None


Example testCases
//test1 - subtraction test:
o:enter number for operand:
i:7
o:enter an operand (+,-,/,*):
i:-
o:enter number for operand:
i:2
o:5.00

//test2 - addition test:
o:enter number for operand:
i:7
o:enter an operand (+,-,/,*):
i:+
o:enter number for operand:
i:2
o:9.00
//
